# Lab 10 - Object detection
## Object recognition with deep neural networks

- Using dnn-module in OpenCV-contributed (https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d6/d0f/group__dnn.html)[https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d6/d0f/group__dnn.html]
- Pretrained models from Caffe. (with new OpenCV you should also be able to run tensorflow.pb models)
- SSD with MobileNet

## Download and setup project

- Download from https://github.com/sigmunjr/lab_10_dnn.git
- write code in lab_10_dnn/Dnn_lab.cpp
- Follow instructions marked by TODO in the code

Check out the documentation to learn how to read caffe models.
